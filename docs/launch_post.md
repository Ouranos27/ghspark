## 🏆 THE WINNER: Version 1 (Problem → Solution)
*Recommended for best engagement and clarity.*

```
Tired of missing GitHub repos before they blow up? 🚀

I built ghspark.vercel.app — discover exploding repos BEFORE they hit trending.

Try searching "AI Agents" and watch the magic ⚡️

Real-time velocity tracking + one-click share drafts for makers.

#buildinpublic #indiemaker @tibo_maker
```

**Why this works:**
- Opens with relatable pain point
- Clear value prop
- Interactive CTA (try it yourself)
- Maker-friendly hashtags

---

## Version 2: Bold Statement

```
GitHub's trending page is broken. It's too slow. 🐌

So I built something better: ghspark.vercel.app

Track repos gaining velocity RIGHT NOW. Not tomorrow. Not next week.

Search any topic → Get sparks → Share instantly.

Built in 48h for @tibo_maker's TMAKER test 🔥

#buildinpublic
```

**Why this works:**
- Controversial hook (trending is broken)
- Shows speed/urgency
- Name-drops Tibo (engagement boost)
- 48h build credibility

---

## Version 3: Maker-Focused

```
As a maker, I was spending hours hunting GitHub for inspiration.

So I automated it. ⚡️

ghspark.vercel.app finds exploding repos before they go viral.

• Custom velocity algorithm
• Topic-based search
• One-click X posts
• Built in 48h

Try "React Libraries" and tell me what you find 👇
```

**Why this works:**
- Personal story (relatable)
- Bullet points (scannable)
- Direct ask for engagement
- Conversation starter

---

## Version 4: Visual/Technical

```
🔥 Just shipped: ghspark.vercel.app

What it does: Discovers GitHub repos exploding in real-time

How: Custom "Spark Score" = (Stars × 2 + Forks) / Days_Live

Why: GitHub trending is too slow for builders

Built with: Next.js + Supabase + Framer Motion

48h build for @tibo_maker's TMAKER challenge 🚀

Try it → React → Share your finds
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows technical chops
- Formula adds credibility
- Tech stack attracts devs
- Clear structure

---

## Version 5: Short & Punchy (Twitter-Optimized)

```
Stop missing viral GitHub repos.

ghspark.vercel.app tracks velocity in real-time ⚡️

Search → Discover → Share

Built in 48h. Try "AI Agents" 🔥

#buildinpublic
```

**Why this works:**
- Ultra-short (high RT potential)
- Three-word formula is memorable
- Direct CTA
- Leaves room for thread

## Thread Version (Multi-Tweet)

**Tweet 1:**
```
I spent 48 hours building a better way to discover GitHub repos 🧵

The problem? GitHub trending is cluttered, slow, and generic.

So I built ghspark.vercel.app — velocity-based discovery for makers ⚡️
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
How it works:

1. Search any topic ("AI Agents", "React Tools", etc.)
2. See repos ranked by "Spark Score" (custom velocity algorithm)
3. One-click generate & share X posts

Real-time data + Supabase caching = survives viral spikes 🚀
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Tech stack:
• Next.js 16 (App Router)
• Supabase + Drizzle ORM
• Framer Motion
• Deployed on Vercel

Multi-layer caching handles Reddit hug of death 💪

Check it out: ghspark.vercel.app
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Why I built this:

As a maker, I was manually hunting GitHub for project ideas and tools.

Wanted something that:
✓ Shows what's HOT right now (not yesterday)
✓ Filters by topic
✓ Makes sharing easy

Try "SaaS Boilerplates" and see what you find 👇
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Built for @tibo_maker's TMAKER 48h challenge.

The test: Ship a production-ready mini-tool with viral potential.

ghspark.vercel.app ⚡️

## Tips for Maximum Engagement

### Do:
- ✅ Include a screenshot or GIF in first tweet
- ✅ Ask a question at the end (drives replies)
- ✅ Tag Tibo (@tibo_maker) for visibility
- ✅ Post during peak hours (US mornings or EU evenings)
- ✅ Reply to your own thread with a "PS: Here's what I learned building this..."

### Don't:
- ❌ Use too many hashtags (max 2-3)
- ❌ Write walls of text
- ❌ Forget to pin the tweet to your profile
- ❌ Post once and disappear (engage with replies!)

---

## Engagement Boosters

**Add to any version:**

1. **Social Proof Hook:**
   - "Just hit 100 searches in first hour 🔥"
   - "5 makers already found their next project"

2. **Curiosity Gap:**
   - "The #1 trending AI repo right now will surprise you"
   - "Found a repo with 10k stars that nobody's talking about"

3. **Call to Action:**
   - "Reply with your favorite find and I'll RT"
   - "What's the most unexpected repo you discover?"
   - "Makers: what topic should I add next?"

---

## Recommended Combo

**My suggestion:** Use **Version 1** (Problem → Solution) as your launch tweet, then immediately reply with a short thread explaining the tech + asking for feedback.

**Example:**

**Main Tweet (Version 1):**

How it works:

Custom "Spark Score" tracks velocity = (Stars × 2 + Forks) / Days_Live

So new repos with rapid growth rank higher than old repos coasting on momentum.

Built with Next.js + Supabase. Survives viral traffic with 3-layer caching 💪
```

**Reply 2:**
```
Built this in 48h for @tibo_maker's TMAKER challenge.

Constraints were:
✓ Data-driven (GitHub API + custom scoring)
✓ Viral potential (one-click sharing)
✓ Gorgeous (dark mode + animations)
✓ Resilient (caching for spikes)

What topic should I try first? 👇
