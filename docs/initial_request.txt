Mini-Tools Maker Application Test
Talk is cheap. Code is the truth.
I'm looking for a killer Maker to join TMAKER. If you want the spot, show me you can ship.
The Mission
Build a production-ready mini-tool in 48 hours.
I don't want a "Hello World" app. I want a growth engine.

Your constraints:

Data-Driven: You must gather data (scrape it, find an obscure API, or aggregate it) and build the value prop around it.
Viral Potential: It needs to be something I would share on my X profile. It needs a "wow" factor or a "utility" factor that makes people click.

Resilient: It must handle a Reddit hug of death or a viral tweet spike.
Gorgeous: Design matters. If it looks like 2010 admin panel, don't bother

The Idea

This is the creativity test.
I'm not giving you the idea. You find it. Look
trustmrr.com
or
tweethunter.io/generate
at
-tweets. That's the vibe. Simple, useful, shareable.
Go wild, it's better to be bold.

The Rules
Time: 48 hours max.
Al: Use ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, whatever. Speed is leverage. However: You are responsible for the code. If the Al hallucinates or writes buggy code, that's on you. "The Al did it" is not an excuse.
Stack: preferred, but not mandatory: NextJS, Firebase/Supabase
Deliverables

Send me a DM a Notion Doc containing:

The Live URL: (No localhosts)
The codebase (public Github repo)
The launch post for X, do your best effort to grab attention
Some notes about:

The Intent: Why this idea? Why will it go viral?
The How: Brief tech stack and data source explanation.
The Post-Mortem: What was easy? What was hard? How would you improve it with 1 more week?
A Important P.S. By submitting a project to me, you agree to the following:

I have the right to share your project/link on my X (with a mention of your account)


I have the option to acquire the codebase from you for $400 if I decide to keep it alive
PS 2: this test is sent at 5+ persons, if you want to give up, absolutely no problem.
